#HOW TO DOWNLOAD



#HOW TO USE
    --Use the Up/Down arrow keys to navigate--

In your terminal, enter ruby/bin.rb. You will be shown our welcome screen with four different options! The first option will
allow you to view all of games by name. The other options allow you to view our games by category or system. If you're feeling generous you can even donate a game! We will just need some information and you can enter the name of your game through the keyboard. After you are finished with your selection you can exit by pressing the exit button(easy enough!)


Thank you for choosing Gaming Destination.
